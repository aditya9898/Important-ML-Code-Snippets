All important python code snippets as i learn them will be uploaded here with a detailed description of what it does.

# 1. Importing Pretrained VGG-19 Model For Tensorflow
Use !wget to download the pretrained weights matrix (.mat) from this [link](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat). Then build model with the function in the code [here](https://github.com/aditya9898/Important-ML-Code-Snippets/blob/master/Importing%20Pretrained%20VGG-19%20Model%20For%20Tensorflow.ipynb).
